Math is Our Hope

I started this initiative because one day, while visiting the hospital with my family, I saw children who wanted to learn math but couldn't. They were trying to learn from heavy books, which was very difficult for them in their situation. That’s when I thought of this project.

My Vision: To help every student, everywhere in the world—especially sick students—to learn and love math. I love math, and through this initiative, I want the whole world to see how beautiful it is.

Future Plans:

Add interactive math games for younger kids.
Create a section for math puzzles to make learning fun.
Collaborate with other students to add more lesson.
